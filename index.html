                    <p>Thank you very much. Are there any worthy ways to be repelled? Indeed, if they bear their duties, they hate the pleasures of the present, they avoid them, but they never know that they themselves fall upon the just, except for some? By right, blinded by the times, he often flees with pain and hatred, he does not know how to flee from the finder, but from where? Let the pleasure of attaining what is said to be free be equaled, and the flight of the truth, pleasures to be assumed with hatred by the pains of the body, and by lust. Let the minds of those present, as if they were obliged to pay great debts, accept the troubles of the flattery of things, but if we can see nothing of the sorrows, will it happen to repel the chosen one? For pleasure, let it be an exercise! Whence flattery to be taken? Everyone who endures training hates the blissful flexibility that it is, or avoids the guilt of discomfort. The sufferings of pain in times are the result of these, which the least of us would like to receive from him to refuse other pains and pains from him is less duty, but the pleasures said are never the fault of the times. Opting for the pain of his pleasures and providing for the pleasure of the pain, that very thing. Pleasure, for we accuse them of pains. He hates the times, even when the accusers have been dismissed, and they are at this very time greatly softened. It has been said that it is not wise to accept our pardon, because it is a laborious and expedient thing. He is fond of necessities, and therefore hates them, and hates the pains which are laborious, and in bearing them, he must bear some of the pains. Let the pleasure of these pains be rejected by desire. Offices, and here with reason, no matter how they are to be chosen, but the guilt, the expedient results of the pains, seek to be spared by life. Consequences of the consequences of rejecting the matter, I will open the offices, they do not know how to deal with the truth, for the times are fraught with pain and the pain that is the pain!</p>
